<div id="csAssignmentTitle" align="center">Magpie Lab - Activity 4</div>

<div id="csContent"> 
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>As stated previously, single keywords are interesting, but better chatbots look for groups of words.
Statements like "I like cats," "I like math class," and "I like Spain" all have the form "I like something."
The response could be "What do you like about something?" This activity will respond to groupings
of words.</p>

<h1>Prepare</h1>
<p>You are going to use the <strong>Activity4</strong> project in this activity. You will need to make Activity4 the active project.
This can be accomplished by right-clicking on the project name and selecting <strong>Sets as Active Project</strong>.</p>

<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>Get to know the revised Magpie class. Run it, using the instructions provided by your teacher.
How does it respond to:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><p>I want to build a robot.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to understand French.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you like me?</p></li>
<li><p>You confuse me.</p></li>
</ul></div>

<h1>Exercises</h1>
<p>Look at the code. See how it handles "I want to" and you/me statements.</p>

<p>Alter the code:</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p>Have it respond to "I want something" statements with "Would you really be happy if you had
something?" In doing this, you need to be careful about where you place the check. Be sure you
understand why. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Statement:</strong> I want fried chicken.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Would you really be happy if you had fried chicken?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have it respond to statements of the form "I something you" with the restructuring "Why do you
something me?" For example:</p>
<p><strong>Statement:</strong> I like you.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Why do you like me?</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Find an example of when this structure does not work well. How can you improve it?</p>
