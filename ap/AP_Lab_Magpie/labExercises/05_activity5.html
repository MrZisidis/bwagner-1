<div id="csContent"> 
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>When you last worked with the Magpie, default responses were handled with a nested if statement.
This certainly worked, and you could add more responses, but it was a bit awkward. An easier way to
keep track of default responses is with an <strong>array</strong>. In this activity, you will see how an array makes
handling default responses much easier.</p>

<h1>Prepare</h1>
<p>You are going to use the <strong>Activity5</strong> project in this activity. You will need to make Activity5 the active project.
This can be accomplished by right-clicking on the project name and selecting <strong>Sets as Active Project</strong>.</p>

<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>Run this version of the Magpie class. You should see no difference in its outward behavior. Instead, it
has been changed so that its internal structure is different. This is called <strong>code refactoring</strong>. That's one of
the big benefits of dealing with methods as black boxes. As long as they perform the action required,
the user does not care about how they perform the action.</p>
<p>Read the code for <strong>getRandomResponse</strong>. Notice that it uses an <strong>array</strong> of responses.</p>

<h1>Exercise</h1>
<p>Alter the array to add four additional random responses. Notice that, because the
<strong>getRandomResponse</strong> method uses the length attribute of the array, you do not need to change
anything else.</p>

<p>Compile and run your code. You should run it until you see all of your new responses.</p>
