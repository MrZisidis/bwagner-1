<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>A jeroo with 50 flowers in its pouch travels across an island one time from East to West
    disabling every net it finds in its path and replacing the net with a flower (first, toss
    a flower at the net to disable it, then hop forward and plant another flower to replace
    the net). The program should use a loop to continuously find and replace nets until the
    shore is reached. Your implementation should work for any island and from any starting
	location on the East shoreline.</p>
<p>Create any jeroo methods you find necessary.</p>
