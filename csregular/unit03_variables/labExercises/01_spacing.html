  <p>To improve the look of the data being displayed on the console window you often want to include 
     spacing to make the data easier to read. In a println statement this can be accomplished simply by
	 adding one or more strings that contain the 'space' character.</p>
	 
<h3>Example 1</h3>
  <div id="csCode">
System.out.println(1 + " " + 2 + " " + 3 + " " + 4 + " " + 5);
</div>
<p>This code produces the following output</p>
<div id="csOutput"><pre>1 2 3 4 5</pre></div>
<p>The println statement includes 5 strings that contain one space character used to space the numbers apart. Notice the use of the
plus '+' operator. Because these '+' operators are position next to a string their purpose has changed. 
Instead of doing an add operation they do a merge or concatenation operation. When the '+' operator is used in
this context it is referred to as the <strong>concatenation operator</strong>.</p>

<div id="csNote">In a println statement any string that is positioned next to a literal value or variable (i.e. anything that is not a string)
   must include the '+' concatentation operator between them. </div>
   
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<div id="csCode"><pre>System.out.println(3 + " + " + 7 + " = " + (3 + 7));
</pre></div>
<p>This code has the following format</p>
<div id="csOutput"><pre>number + string + number + string + number</pre></div>
<P>and produces the following output</P>
<div id="csCode"><pre>3 + 7 = 10</pre></div>
<p>There two things you can learn from this example.</p>
<div id="csList"><ol>
<li>Any string in a println statement that is not at the beginning or the end of the statement must have a
    '+' concatenation operator before and after it.</li>
<li>Once a println statement encounters a '+' concatenation operator all '+' signs after the first automatically
    become concatentation operators. To prevent a '+' add operation from turning into a concatention operator
	you must wrap parentheses around it and its two operands. This works because in the order of operations
	parentheses are evaluated first therefore the code (3 + 7) will evaluate to 10 before the rest of the
	statement is evaluated.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Directions</h1>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li>Use the println statement to produce the output shown below. </li>
<li>The println statement <strong>must</strong> do the math calculation at the end of each problem and display it. </li>
<li>In this assignment no numbers are allowed
   to be displayed as a string (i.e. "45").</li>
   </ul></div>

          Simple Math
-------------------------------
5 + 10 = 15
30 / 5 = 6
50 + 20 - 6 * 3 = 52
40 / (3 + 5) * 2 = 10

The remainder when you divide 15 by 4 is 3.
