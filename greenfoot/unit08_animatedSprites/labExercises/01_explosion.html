<p>In this lesson we introduce a new class named <strong>AnimatedActor</strong>. AnimatedActor enables actors to be animated 
   by allowing them to have multiple images assigned to them. AnimatedActors retrieve 
   their images from <strong>sprite sheets</strong>.</p>
   
   
<p>To demonstrate how the AnimatedActor class works let's walk through the steps needed to animate a series of explosion images.</p>

<h1>AnimatedActor Class</h1>
<p>Double-click the AnimatedActor class to view its code. Familiarize yourself with the methods that are provided by this class. 
The AnimatedActor class was written by me and is not part of the Greenfoot environment so it must be added to projects that want to use it.</p>

 
<h1>Sprite Sheet</h1>
<p>A <strong>sprite sheet</strong> is a file that contains a series of images with each image having the same dimensions. Placing all
   of the images into one file makes it easier to load the images into a program. Look at the sprite sheet for an explosion. (The image has been
   reduce in size so that it will fit on this page.)</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Explosion_01.png"></div>
<p>Each image on the sprite sheet must be the same size. For example all 13 images on this sheet have dimensions of 196 x 190. </p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Explosion_02.png"></div>

<h1>Explosion Class</h1>
<p>Double-click the Explosion class to view its code. Look at the Explosion class constructor shown below.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Explosion_03.png"></div>
<p>The constructor includes 4 parameters used in creating an AnimatedActor.</p>
<ul id="csList">
<li><p><strong>imageFile</strong> - the name of the sprite sheet file</p></li>
<li><p><strong>numFrames</strong> - the number of images(frames) contained in the sprite sheet</p></li>
<li><p><strong>frameWidth</strong> - the width of each frame in the sheet</p></li>
<li><p><strong>frameHeight</strong> - the height of each frame in the sheet</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Every class that is a subclass of AnimatedActor must include this four parameter constructor and the first line of the constructor
   must include the following line of code.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>super(imageFile, numframes, frameWidth, frameHeight);</pre></div>
<p>The keyword <strong>super</strong> is used to pass the information about the sprite sheet onto the superclass (AnimatedActor) so that
   it can be used by the AnimatedActor class to animate the actor.</p>
   
<h1>MyWorld Class</h1>
<p>The MyWorld class is where the Explosion object is created. Several AnimatedActor methods are called to do some initial setup
   for the animation. Let's look at this code line by line.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>explosion = new Explosion("explosion_sheet.png", 13, 196, 190);</pre></div>
<p>This line of code creates the Explosion object. "explosion_sheet.png" is the name of the sprite sheet. 13 is the number of frames
   in the sprite sheet, 196 is the width of each image(frame) in the sheet, and 190 is the height of each frame in the sheet.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>addObject(explosion, getWidth()/2, getHeight()/2);</pre></div>
<p>This code adds the Explosion object to the world positioned at its center.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>explosion.setAutoAdvance(true);</pre></div>
<p>The method <strong>setAutoAdvance</strong> turns on or off the auto advance feature. When set to "true" this method enables the
   frames to be cycled through automatically which allows the actor to be animated.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>explosion.setAdvanceSpeed(10);</pre></div>
<p>The method <strong>setAdvanceSpeed</strong> sets the animation speed for the actor. The larger the number passed as a parameter
   the slower the animation will advance through its frames. A value of zero represents the fastest animation speed.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>explosion.setLooping(true);</pre></div>
<p>The method <strong>setLooping</strong> turns on or off the looping feature. If looping is set to "true" when the animation
   reaches its last frame it advances back to the first frame and starts the animation over again.</p>
   
 <h1>Program Modifications</h1> 
 <ol id="csList">
 <li><p>If you have not already done so compile and run the program.</p></li>
 <li><p>Modify the animation speed by setting it to 0. Compile and run the program.</p></li>
 <li><p>Modify the animation speed by setting it to 100. Compile and run the program.</p></li>
 <li><p>Set the looping feature to false. Compile and run the program.</p></li>
 <li><p>Set the auto advance feature to false. Compile and run the program.</p></li>
 <li><p>Add the following act method to the <strong>Explosion</strong> class.</p>
 
 <div id="csCode" style="width: 550px"><pre>public void act()
 {
     super.act();  // call AnimatedSprite's act method
        
     String key = Greenfoot.getKey();
     if("right".equals(key))
     {
         setFrame(getFrame() + 1);  // advance to next frame
     }
}</pre></div>
 <p>Notice the command <strong>super.act()</strong>. This line of code is required and must be the first line of the
    act method.</p>
 <p>Compile and run the program. Use the right arrow key to advance the frames.</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Turn the looping feature on then compile and run the program.</p></li>
 </ol>
