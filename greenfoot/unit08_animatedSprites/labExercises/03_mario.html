<p>In this lesson features of the <strong>AnimatedActor</strong> class are demonstrated by animating a Mario actor as he moves.</p>

<h1>Mario Sprite Sheet</h1>
<p>The mario sprite sheet consists of 20 frames. The first 10 frames are right facing and are numbered from 0 - 9. The second 10
   frames are left facing and are numbered from 10 - 19. </p>

<h1>Mario Class</h1>
  <p>The Mario class's <strong>movementTest</strong> method is responsible for 
    allowing a Mario object to move horizontally within the world. As a mario 
    moves it is also animated using the sprite sheet frames. When he is moving 
    right only frames 0 through 9 are used and when he is moving left only frames 
    10 through 19 are used. The method movementTest is shown below. Study the 
    code until you understand how it works.</p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1> 
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Complete the method <strong>jumpTest</strong> so that Mario has the ability to jump and land on the ground. The ground is not an actor
       instead it is part of the background image. The top of ground is located 320 pixels down from the top of the world.</p>
	   
	 <p>I have already included the instance variables necessary to implement jumping.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <strong>Platform</strong> class add a platform to the world and then give Mario the ability to land on it.</p></li>
