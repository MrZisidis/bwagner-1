<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<p>In this lesson you are going to implement the method <strong>rotateFlappyBird</strong>. This method should adjust
   Flappy's rotation angle depending upon whether he is going up, down, or flying level. The illustration below shows
   five rotation angles Flappy can be in relative to his flying direction (2 up, 2 down, and 1 level).</p>
   
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird2_01.png"></div>
   
<p>The illustration below shows some of the rotation angles for objects added to a world. When an object is facing East its rotation angle is 0. 
   When it is facing North its rotation angle is 270. When it is facing South its rotation angle is 90. </p>
   
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird2_02.png"></div>
   
<p>Use the following pseudocode to help you with your implementation:</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:650px"><pre>
if vertical velocity is less than -8 then
    set Flappy's rotation angle to 300
end if
if vertical velocity is greater than or equal to -8 and less than -4 then
    set Flappy's rotation angle to 320
end if
if vertical velocity is greater than or equal to -4 and less than 4 then
    set Flappy's rotation angle to 0
end if
if vertical velocity is greater than 4 and less than or equal to 8 then
    set Flappy's rotation angle to 40
end if
if vertical velocity is greater than 8 then
    set Flappy's rotation angle to 80
end if
</pre></div>
<p>*Remember a negative vertical velocity means Flappy is going up(climbing) and a positive vertical velocity means he is going down(falling).</p>
