<h1>Animate Flappy</h1>
<p>In this lesson we animate Flappy by making his wings move up and down (flap) as he flies.</p>
<p>To animate Flappy we are going to use the following four images:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird5_01.png"></div>
	
<h1>Flappy Class</h1>
<p>The code used to animate Flappy can be explained in four steps:</p>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p><strong>Declare Instance Variables</strong></p>
<p>Look at the new instance variables added to the Flappy class.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird5_02.png"></div>
<p>The four image variables are used to store the new images.</p>
<p>The <strong>frame</strong> variable is used to track which image(frame) is currently visible.</p>
<p>The <strong>animationCounter</strong> variable is a simple counter that is used to flip the frames at regular intervals.</p>
<p>The <strong>ANIMATION_SPEED</strong> constant establishes how often the frames are flipped (frame rate).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Define a Flappy Constructor</strong></p>
<div align="center"><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird5_03.png"></div>
<p>Recall that a constructor is executed when an object is first created. This constructor loads all the image files
   and stores them in variables so that Flappy can use them. Since the 2nd image and the 4th image are identical the constructor assigns
   the reference of the 2nd image to the 4th image variable. By doing it this way only 3 images have to be loaded from a file
   instead of four.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Define animateFlappyBird Method</strong></p>
<div align="center"><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird5_04.png"></div>
<p>The animateFlappyBird method is responsible for animating Flappy by cycling through its 4 images at regular intervals. Study
   the code and see if you can understand how it works.</p>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Make Call to animateFlappyBird</strong></p>
<p>To animate Flappy the method animateFlappyBird is called in the act method. Placing this call in the act method will cause
   Flappy to "flap" his wings continually.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird5_05.png"></div>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<p>Compile and execute the program. Notice that Flappy "flaps" his wings the entire time he is in flight. Modify the program 
   so that Flappy only "flaps" his wings when he is going up.</p>
