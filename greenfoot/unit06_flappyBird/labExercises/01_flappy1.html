<p>In this 8 part series we are going to write a version of the FlappyBird game. The FlappyBird game was a mobile-device game developed by a programmer
   in Vietnam in 2013. In January of 2014 it became the most downloaded free game on the IOS App Store, but in February of 2014 the
   developer took it down citing guilt over its addictive nature and overuse. </p>
   
<p>The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes without coming into contact with them.</p>

<h1>FlappyBird Class</h1>
<p>To start our game we create two methods in the FlappyBird class named <strong>fly</strong> and <strong>displayGameOver</strong>.
   The fly method allows Flappy to move up and down vertically. The <strong>BOOST_SPEED</strong> constant provides lift so the bird goes upward(climbs) and as
   <strong>gravity(g)</strong> is applied the bird gradually goes downward(falls).</p>

<p>The <strong>displayGameOver</strong> method is left as an exercise.</p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<p>Use the pseudocode below to implement the <strong>displayGameOver</strong> method. This method should display the message 
   "GameOver" centered in the middle of the world and then end the game by calling the Greenfoot method stop.</p>
