<p>In this lesson a parallax background is added. Parallax is a special effect where multiple layers of a background are
   scrolled at different speeds. Another trick you can do to enhance the parallax effect and give your game the illusion of depth is to change the transparency
   levels of images that make up the background.</p>

<h1>Parallax Background</h1>
<p>In our FlappyBird game parallax is introduced by adding a ground image to the world that sits on top of the background image. This
   ground image is not part of the background image, instead it is a sprite(actor) that is added to the world. Since the ground is in the 
   foreground it scrolls a little faster than the background image.</p>

<p>The following <strong>Ground</strong> class was added to the scenario. It uses the same scrolling technique that was used to scroll the background 
   image. </p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<p>Add a pause game feature that will pause the game when the user presses the "space" key. To continue the game the user presses the
   "space" key again. To complete this task do the following:</p>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Add the following variable declaration to the FlappyWorld class.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:550px"><pre>static boolean paused = false;</pre></div>
<p>Notice the use of the keyword <strong>static</strong> in the front of the variable declaration. The static keyword is used to define
   a special kind of variable called a <strong>class</strong> variable. Class variables are different from instance variables in that they
   belong to the class they are defined whereas instance variables belong to an object and are created when an object is instantiated(created).
   Each object has is own set of instance variables and these variables belong only to that object, whereas a class contains only one version of a class
   variable and it can be shared among all the objects of that class. Class variables can also be accessed in other classes by using dot notation
   similar to the way objects access methods but instead of using (object.method) notation use (class.variable) notation.
   For example suppose you would like to use the paused variable created in FlappyWorld class in the Flappy class. This can be accomplished by 
   using code like the following:</p>
   <div id="csCode" style="width:300px"><pre>if(<div id="csHighlight"><pre>FlappyWorld</pre></div>.paused == false)</pre></div>
</li>
<br>
<li><p>Add the following method to the FlappyWorld class.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:550px"><pre>
public void pauseTest()
{
   if("space".equals(Greenfoot.getKey()))
   {
      if(paused == true)       // toggle paused
         paused = false;
      else
         paused = true;
   }
}
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Add a call to the <strong>pauseTest</strong> method in the FlappyWorld's act method. Then wrap an if statement around all of 
   the code in the act method, except the call to pauseTest, so that the code will not be executed when the game is paused. When both
   of the tasks are complete the act method should look like the following:</p>
   
 <div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird7_03.png"></div>  
</li>
<li><p>Add an if statement to the act method for each of the following classes: Background, Ground, Pipe, and Flappy so that the 
       code in these act methods will not be executed when the game is paused.</p>
	<p>The if statement should be similar to one added to the act method of the FlappyWorld class except when referencing the
	   paused variable the FlappyWorld class name needs to be included with dot notation like the example below:</p>
	   
	   <div id="csCode" style="width:300px"><pre>if(<div id="csHighlight"><pre>FlappyWorld</pre></div>.paused == false)</pre></div>
	   
	   </li>
</ol>
	
	
	<br>
</div>
