<h1>Adding Pipes</h1>
  <p>In this lesson pipes are added to the world that FlappyBird has to fly between. 
    There is a top pipe and a bottom pipe that scroll across the world from right 
    to left at regular intervals. The two pipes are positioned vertically at random 
    with the distance between them defined by a constant in the FlappyWorld class 
    named SPACE_BETWEEN_PIPES.</p>
   
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird3_01.png"></div>

<p>The pipes are organized into three separate classes: <strong>Pipe</strong>, <strong>TopPipe</strong>, and <strong>BottomPipe</strong>.</p>

<div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird3_02.png"></div>

<p>TopPipe and BottomPipe are subclasses of Pipe. This means they both "act" like a Pipe since they inherit the Pipe class's act method.
   The reason for organizing the pipes this way is so that all pipes, regardless if they are a TopPipe or BottomPipe, move in the same way
   but they can have different images associated with them.</p>

<p>A method named <strong>createPipes</strong> is defined in the FlappyWorld class. Each time it is called in the FlappyWorld act method it creates
   both a BottomPipe object and a TopPipe object and adds them to the world just out of view to the right.</p>
   
<h1>FlappyBird act Method</h1>
<p>There is some interesting code in the FlappyBird act method. Notice that the <strong>Pipe</strong> class is an argument(parameter) for the method call
   <strong>getOneIntersectingObject</strong>.</p>
   
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird3_04.png"></div>
   
<p>This code makes use of one of the benefits of inheritance. Since BottomPipe and TopPipe are subclasses of Pipe this if statement
   will cause the game to end if Flappy collides with any pipe, regardless if the pipe is a BottomPipe or TopPipe. There is no 
   need to check them for collisions separately.</p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>

  <p>Implement the FlappyWorld's <strong>act</strong> method so that the method 
    <strong>createPipes</strong> is called at regular intervals resulting in the pipes being spaced 
    100 units a part. To accomplish this task follow these steps:</p>
   
<ol id="csList">
  <li><p>Define an integer variable named <strong>counter</strong> as an instance variable for the FlappyWorld class.</p></li>
  <li><p>Add the following code to the FlappyWorld act method.</p>
  <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>counter++;
System.out.println(counter);</pre></div>
  <p>Compile and execute the program. A console window should appear that displays counter.</p>
  <div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird3_03.png"></div>
  </li>
  <li><p>Add the following if statement to the act method below the println statement:</p>
  <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>if(counter == 100)
{
   counter = 0;
}</pre></div>
<p>Compile and execute the program. Notice that counter is reset to zero each time it reaches 100. We can use this to create pipes every 100 steps.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Add the following line of code inside the if statement.</p></li>
  <div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>createPipes();</pre></div>
<p>Compile and execute the program.</p>
<li><p>Remove the println statement you added in step 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the comment symbols from the addObject method call in the FlappyBird constructor so that the 
     FlappyBird will appear. Compile and execute the program.</p></li>
</ol>
