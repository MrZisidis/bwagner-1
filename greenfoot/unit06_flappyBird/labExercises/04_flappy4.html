</ol>

<p>In this version of the program a scoreboard has been added to the world. When FlappyBird passes through a set of pipes the
   scoreboard is increased by one. The scoreboard does not appear until Flappy reaches the first set of pipes.</p>

<h1>Scoreboard Class</h1>

<p>The following Scoreboard class is used to create a ScoreBoard object.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird4_01.png"></div>

<p>An image is not initially assigned to the Scoreboard class in the Greenfoot environment. The image is instead created in the 
   Scoreboard's constructor. The image is created as a blank image with dimensions 150 x 80.</p>

<p>The method <strong>setScore</strong> is used to update the score when Flappy passes through a set of pipes. The method follows
   these steps to update the scoreboard:</p>
   <ul id="csList">
   <li><p>Gets a reference to the image.</p></li>
   <li><p>Clears the image so it is blank.</p></li>
   <li><p>Selects the font attributes used to draw on the image.</p></li>
   <li><p>Draws the value of the parameter score onto the image.</p></li>
   </ul>
   
<h1>FlappyWorld Class</h1>
<p>A Scoreboard object is created, added to the world, and updated in the FlappyWorld class.</p>
<p>Look at the method <strong>displayScore</strong>.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird4_02.png"></div>
<p>This method is responsible for increasing the score and calling the ScoreBoard method <strong>setScore</strong> to update the
    scoreboard with the new score.</p>
<p>The <strong>act</strong> method calls the <strong>displayScore</strong> method each time Flappy passes through a set of pipes. The tricky part
   of this code is knowing when Flappy passes through the pipes. This is accomplished by adding a couple of counter variables to the 
   FlappyWorld class. Recall from the previous lesson that by using a counter variable and an if statement we were able to space the 
   pipes so that they were always 100 units apart. Knowing this fact, namely that the pipes are always 100 units apart, all we have to do 
   is count the number of "steps" Flappy takes. If he takes at least 100 then we know he made it through one set of pipes. 
   Look at the following code in the act method.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird4_03.png"></div>
<p>Look again at the code from the previous lesson that was used to space the pipes 100 units apart.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird4_04.png"></div>
<p>In this lesson I decided to use a different approach. Instead of counting to 100 and then resetting the counter back to zero I choose to
   check to see if the counter is divisible by 100. By doing it this way it made the rest of the code easier to implement. Notice that I also 
   changed the name of the counter variable to <strong>pipeCounter</strong>.</p>
   
<p>It is the next two if statements that help us determine when Flappy passes through a set of pipes. I did some test runs and 
    determined that Flappy reaches the first set of pipes when pipeCounter equals 210. I stored this value in a constant named
	<strong>FIRST_PIPE</strong>. The first if statement is used to determine when Flappy reaches the first pipes. From that point on we
	start counting Flappy's steps by incrementing a variable named <strong>flappyCounter</strong>. When the second if 
	statement is true we know that Flappy has reached the next set of pipes so the displayScore method is called to update the scoreboard.</p>
   
   
<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<p>A <strong>CountDown</strong> class is included in this scenario that has the exact same functionality as the ScoreBoard class. Use
   this CountDown class to display a number count down (like when a rocket is getting ready to blast off) so that the
   game player knows when the game is about to begin. The CountDown class is designed to display numbers in the following format:</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird4_05.png"></div>  

  <p>To complete this task you are going to implement the method <strong>displayCountDown</strong> located in the
     FlappyWorld class.</p> 

<p>Use the following pseudocode to aid you in your implementation:</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width: 650px"><pre>Create a CountDown object and store its reference in a variable 
   named <strong>countDown</strong>
Add the countDown object to the world
Use a for loop to count down from 5 to 1
   Use the countDown object to call the CountDown class's setCount method. Pass the setCount method your for loop's loop control variable 
   Call the Greenfoot class's delay method: Greenfoot.delay(25)
Call the removeObject method and pass it the countDown object through its parameter list so that the countDown object is removed from the world after
it finishes counting down.
