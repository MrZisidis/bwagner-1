<p>In this 8 part series lesson we are going to write a version of the FlappyBird game. The FlappyBird game was a mobile-device game developed by a programmer
   in Vietnam in 2013. In January of 2014 it became the most downloaded free game on the IOS App Store, but in February of 2014 the
   developer took it down citing guilt over its addictive nature and overuse. </p>
   
<p>The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes without coming into contact with them.</p>
