<p>In this lesson we learn how to make an actor shoot by demonstrating how to make a Ketchup Cannon.</p>

<h1>MyWorld Class</h1>
<p>The MyWorld class adds a Cannon object to the middle of the world.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/KetchupCannon_01.png"></div>
 
<h1>Cannon Class</h1>
<p>The cannon shoots a KetchupBall when the left mouse button is pressed. The cannon moves by tracking the mouse's current
   location. All of the code for the Cannon is in its act method. Study this code until you understand how it works.</p>

 <h1>Program Modifications</h1>
  <p>Modify the KetchupBall class's act method so that when the ball has traveled 
    more than 150 units it is removed from the world and replaced with a Splat 
    object. When the Splat appears on the screen play the bloop sound. To accomplish 
    this do the following:</p>
  <ol id="csList">
  <li>
      <p>Create an if statement that becomes true when the <strong>distance</strong> 
        variable is greater than 150. The rest of the code discussed below should 
        be placed inside this if statement.</p>
    </li>
  <li><p>Before we delete the KetchupBall from the world we need to store some of its information so that it
      is not lost when it is deleted. Inorder to replace the KetchupBall with a Splat object the Splat object 
	  needs to know where the KetchupBall was located when it was deleted and it also needs a reference to the
	  world the KetchupBall belonged. To do this add the following code to the KetchupBall's act method.</p>
	  <div id="csCode"><pre>int x = getX();              // store current x value
int y = getY();              // store current y value
World world = getWorld();    // store reference to world it is in</pre></div>
	  </li>
	  <li><p>Add the following code to the act method that will remove the KetchupBall from the world.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:500px"><pre>getWorld().removeObject(this);    // this means this object</pre></div>
</li>
	  <li><p>Create a Splat object named <strong>splat</strong>.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Add the splat object to the world using the World class's <strong>addObject</strong> method. The
	  addObject method requires three parameters: the object you want to add to the world and the x and y 
	  coordinates of the place you would like the object to appear. Since at this point in the code the KetchupBall
	  no longer exists you cannot use its getWorld() method any longer. That is why the <strong>world</strong>
	  variable was created. Use it to access the world instead:  <strong>world.addObject(...)</strong>.
	  Note: the three dots should be replaced by the three parameters addObject requires.</p></li>
  <li><p>Add the bloop sound to the world so that the bloop sound is played when the splat object appears.</p></li>
  </ol>
