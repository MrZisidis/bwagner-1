<h1>Greenfoot Classes</h1>
<p>The Greenfoot environment consists of seven core classes:</p>
<div id="csList"><p>
<ul>
<li>Actor</li>
<li>Greenfoot</li>
<li>GreenfootImage</li>
<li>GreenfootSound</li>
<li>MouseInfo</li>
<li>UserInfo</li>
<li>World</li>
</ul></p>
</div>
<p>These classes are specifically designed to make writing games and graphical simulations easier. In this assignment you are introduced to the
   <strong>World</strong> and <strong>Actor</strong> classes.</p>
<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>In Greenfoot a <strong>scenario</strong> is a computer program consisting of Java classes, images, and sounds.
     Follow the steps below to create your first Greenfoot scenario.</p>


<div id="csList"><p><ol>
<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<li>Navigate to your Home Directory(H: Drive) and create a new folder named <strong>MyGreenfoot</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the Greenfoot icon to open the Greenfoot Environment.</li>
<li>Select Scenario --> New</li>
<li>Navigate to the MyGreenfoot folder you created in step 1, type <strong>MyFirst</strong>, and click the create button.<br><br>
    The following screen should appear:<br><br>
	<div align="center"><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst1.png" height="80%" width="80%"></div>
	</li>

<h2>Creating a World</h2>
<p>Once a scenario has been created the next step is to create a world. A world in Greenfoot is a two-dimensional grid that you can place
    "actors" on. From a programming perspective a world is a class that contains variables and methods. Double-click on the <strong>World</strong> button to 
	see the methods defined in the World class.</p>
<li>Right-clicking on the World button brings up the folowing menu:<br><br>
    <div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst2.png"></div><br>
	Select --> <strong>New Subclass...</strong></li>
<li>In the New Class box type <strong>MyWorld</strong> and click <strong>Ok</strong>.<br><br>
    <div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst3.png"></div>
	<p>You should now see a subclass named <strong>MyWorld</strong> listed below the World class.</p>
	<div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst4.png"></div>
	<p><strong>What is a subclass and why did we make one?</strong></p>
	<p>Because of the way the World class was designed it cannot be modified. That means no code can be added or removed. However to make our own programs
	    do new and different things we need to be able to add our own code to this class. In Java, this can be accomplished by making a subclass.
		A subclass is a class that is a copy of another class with the new class having the same capabilities as the original class (i.e. same methods), but with the 
		added benefit of being able to add new code.</p></li>
<li><p>Double-click on MyWorld to see your new class.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst5.png"></div>
<p>Notice the use of the keyword <strong>extends</strong> on the line of code that defines the MyWorld class. The process of one class
   extending another class is called <strong>inheritance</strong>. Inheritance is one of the most important features of object-oriented 
   programming because it allows a class to inherit all of the capabilities of another class plus include additional code that extends the new
   class's capabilities beyond that of its parent class. The importance of this feature will become more apparent as we explore Greenfoot further.
</li>

<h2>Creating an Actor</h2>
<li>
<p>The next step in building a Greenfoot scenario is to add actors to your new world. Greenfoot provides an <strong>Actor</strong> class for this purpose.
   Double-click on the Actor button to see the methods defined in the Actor class.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Like the World class, the Actor class cannot be modified so we must create a new class that is a subclass of the 
   Actor class. To create a new subclass right-click on the Actor button and select <strong>New subclass...</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Give the new subclass the name <strong>Bug</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Greenfoot allows you to assign a graphic to an Actor subclass. Under <strong>Images Categories:</strong> select animals then scroll down the list
   on the right until you see the image <strong>ladybug_02</strong>. Select the image and click Ok.</p>
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst6.png" height="70%" width="70%"></div>
   </li>
<h2>Adding Code to Bug Class</h2>
<li><p>Double-click on the Bug button to see the Bug class.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that the Bug class extends the Actor class. This means a Bug can do everything an Actor can do. For example,
an Actor can do things like move and turn. What's cool is that our Bug class can now can do these things as well.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the most important methods the Bug class inherits from the Actor class is the <strong>act</strong> method.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst7.png"></div>
<p>The act method is important because when you execute a scenario the act method is called repeatedly the entire time the program is
   running. Any code placed in the act method will be executed many times every second. This is what makes animations and games possible.</p>
<p>The act method, as it is written in the Actor class, doesn't really do anything useful, therefore in our Bug class we are going to 
   need to add some of our own code to this method. In programming terminology, we say we are <strong>overriding</strong> the act method.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how this works add the following line of code to the act method:</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:150px"><pre>move(1);</pre></div>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst8.png"></div>
<p>Each time the act method is called our Bug will move one unit ahead. Remember our Bug knows how to move because
   it inherited this behavior from the Actor class.</p></li>
<li><p>Press the <strong>close</strong> button.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst9.png"></div></li>
<h2>Compile Scenario</h2>
<li><p>Before you can execute a scenario you must compile it. Press the <strong>compile</strong> button.</p></li>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst10.png"></div></li>
<h2>Place Bug in the World</h2>
<li><p>So far you have created a Bug class and added code to make a bug move. The next step is to add a bug to the world.
       To do this you need to create a Bug object, using the Bug class, and then add this Bug object to the world.</p>
		<p>There are three ways you can add an Actor to the world. <strong>Use each technique to add a Bug object to the world.</strong></p>
		<h3>Method 1</h3>
		<ul id="csList">
			<li><p>Right-click mouse on Bug class</p></li>
			<li><p>Select <strong>New Bug()</strong></p></li>
			<li><p>Use the mouse to place the Bug object in the world.</strong></p></li>
		<div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst11.png"></div></li>
		</ul>	   
		
		<h3>Method 2</h3>
		<ul id="csList">
			<li><p>Click the mouse on the Bug class to select it.</p></li>
			<li><p>Hold down the <strong>shift key</strong>. A Bug object will appear.</strong></p></li>
			<li><p>Drag the Bug object to the world and click the left mouse button to place it in the world.</strong></p></li>
		<div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst12.png"></div></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Method 3</h3>
		<ul id="csList">
			<li><p>Double click on the MyWorld class to view its code.</p></li>
			<li><p>Inside the MyWorld constructor place the following code:</p>
			
			<div id="csCode" style="width:600px"><pre>Bug bug = new Bug();                            // create bug object
addObject(bug, getWidth()/2, getHeight()/2);    // add bug object to world</pre></div>

<p>This code will place a Bug object in the center of the world.</p></li>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst13.png"></div>
			<li><p>To see the Bug you must compile the program.</strong></p></li>
		
		</ul>
</li>	

<h2>Execute Scenario</h2>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Act</strong> button to execute the Act method one time.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Run</strong> button to execute the Act method repeatedly.</p></li>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/MyFirst14.png"></div>
<h2>Create Your Own SubClass</h2>
<li><p>Create a subclass of the Actor class. Give it a name and assign it an image.</p></li>
<li><p>Create an object of your new Actor subclass using <strong>Method 3</strong> and add it to the world as described above.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile and execute the scenario.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>Method 3</strong> to add a second object of your new Actor subclass to the world at a different location.</p> For example, the following code would add a new Bug object
       at location (100, 200):</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:600px"><pre>Bug bug2 = new Bug();     // create bug object
addObject(bug2, 100, 200);     // add bug object to world</pre></div>
	   </li>
<li><p>Compile and execute the scenario.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the benefit of using Method 3 for adding actors to a world as opposed to Method 1 or Method 2?</p></li>
