<h1>Tracker Class</h1>
  <p>Look at the Actor classes section for this scenario.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Moving Actors_03.png"></div>
<p>Notice that the <strong>Tracker class</strong> is a subclass of Actor. This means that a Tracker object can do everything that an Actor can do plus any additional
   behavior defined in the Tracker class. Double-click on the Tracker class to view its code. Notice there are two methods defined in the Tracker class both named 
   <strong>leaveTrack.</strong> A Tracker can move just like an Actor but it also has the added feature of being able to leave tracks as it moves.</p>
<h1>BoxBug Class</h1>
<p>A <strong>BoxBug</strong> is a subclass of Tracker. This means that a BoxBug is a Tracker and can do everything a Tracker can do, and since a Tracker is
an Actor the BoxBug can also do all of the Actor behaviors as well. So a BoxBug is an Actor and a Tracker.</p>

<p>Double-click on the BoxBug class to view its code.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Moving Actors_04.png"></div>
<p>Notice that the BoxBug class <strong>extends</strong> the Tracker class. This establishes the inheritance behavior described above.</p>
<p>The idea of inheritance in programming is that one class inherits the behavior of another class then extends this behavior so the 
   new subclass can <strong>do more</strong> than its parent. The new behavior of a BoxBug, defined in its act method, is to travel in a box or square pattern.
   And since a BoxBug is a Tracker it can also leave tracks as it moves by calling the <strong>leaveTrack</strong> method it inherited from Tracker.</p>

<h1>BoxBug Object in Action</h1>
<p>To see a BoxBug's behavior add a BoxBug object to the world using one of the three techniques described in the previous lesson.
Use BoxBug as a model to help you make the program modifications listed below.</p>
<br><hr>
<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>A <strong>CircleBug</strong> is a Tracker. Add code to the CircleBug's act method so that a CircleBug moves in a circle pattern. It should leave tracks
 as it moves. You can change the color of tracks and their thickness by providing the color and thickness as parameters to the method. For example,
 the following code will draw tracks in the color red with a thickness of 3:</p>
 <div id="csCode" style="width:300px"><pre>leaveTrack(Color.red, 3);</pre></div>
 <p>This code will draw tracks using a custom color with a thickness of 1:</p>
 <div id="csCode" style="width:300px"><pre>leaveTrack(new Color(30, 180, 55), 1);</pre></div>
      <p><strong>Hint:</strong> if the distance moved and the degrees turned at 
        each step when multiplied together equal 360 then the Bug will make a 
        complete circle.</p>

 </li>
 <li><p>A <strong>StarBug</strong> is a Tracker. Add code to the StarBug's act method so that a StarBug moves in a star pattern. It should leave tracks
 as it moves.</p>
 <div><img src="greenfoot/images/StarBug_01.png"></div>
 </li>
 <li><p>A <strong>SpiralBug</strong> is a Tracker. Add code to the SpiralBug's act method so that a SpiralBug moves in a spiral pattern. It should
  leave tracks as it moves. </p>
 <p><strong>Hint:</strong> the amount you move needs to increase each time the act method is called. 
     Define any <strong>instance variables</strong> you find necessary.</p>
