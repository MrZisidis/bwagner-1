<h1>Download and Open Scenario</h1>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Click on the following link to download the Scenario: <a href="greenfoot/scenarios/Random Numbers.zip" style="color:#00F; font-size:1.0em; font-weight:600;" >Random Numbers</a></p></li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Open</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the folder <strong>Random Numbers</strong> and paste it in your <strong>MyGreenfoot</strong> folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Launch Greenfoot and select Open from the Scenario menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to your MyGreenfoot folder, select the Random Numbers Scenario, and click Open.</p></li>
</ol> 
<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>In previous lessons you created random numbers using the Math class's <strong>random</strong> method. The following code
   generates a random number between 1 and 100 inclusive.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:625px"><pre>
int num = (int)(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
</pre></div> 
<p>Greenfoot provides another way to generate random numbers. The following code also generates a random number between 1 and 100 inclusive.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:625px"><pre>
int num = Greenfoot.getRandomNumber(100) + 1;
</pre></div> 
<p>You can still use the Math class's random method if you prefer.</p>
<h1>Smiley Class</h1>
<p>Click on the <strong>Smiley</strong> class to view its code. You will notice that it does not contain any methods. The only thing that makes the Smiley
class different from the Actor class is there is an image of a smiley face associated with it. Since the Smiley face does not have any special behavior
no additional methods are necessary.</p>

<h1>MyWorld class</h1>
<p>Click on the <strong>MyWorld</strong> class to view its code.</p>
<p>The MyWorld class includes an <strong>act</strong> method. Recall that in Greenfoot act methods are called automatically when the user presses the 
Run button. Any code placed inside these methods will be executed repeatedly while the program is running.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Random Numbers_01.png"></div>
<p>The code in the act method creates a Smiley object and adds it to the world at a random location. Since this code is inside the act method 
   this process is repeated continually. Notice that the code utilizes the <strong>getRandomNumber</strong> method to place the Smiley objects
   at random locations within the boundaries of the world. This is accomplished through the use of the World class's <strong>getWidth</strong> and <strong>getHeight</strong>
   methods. These methods return the dimensions of the world.</p>
   
<h1>Compile and Execute</h1>
<p>Compile and execute the program.</p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>To better organize the program your first task is to create a new void method in the MyWorld class named <strong>createSmiley</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut and paste all of the code currently in the act method into this new method.</p></li>
<li><p>In the act method make a call to the <strong>createSmiley</strong> method.</p></li>
<p>When you have completed all three tasks the MyWorld class should look like the following:</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Random Numbers_02.png"></div>
<li><p>Compile and execute the program to verify that it still works.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a method named <strong>createRandomBug</strong> to the MyWorld class.</p></li>
<li>
      <p>Place the following code in the method.</p>
    </li>
<div id="csCode" style="width:625px"><pre>
RandomBug bug = new RandomBug();
addObject(bug, getWidth() / 2, getHeight() / 2);
</pre></div>
<li><p>In the MyWorld constructor make a call to the <strong>createRandomBug</strong> method. Code added to the MyWorld constructor is
    executed once right before the act method is called.</p>
<p>When completed the MyWorld class should look like the following:</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Random Numbers_03.png"></div></li>
<li><p>Click on the <strong>RandomBug</strong> class to view its code.</p></li>
<li>
      <p>Add code to the RandomBug's act method so that RandomBug <strong>moves</strong> and <strong>turns</strong> 
        randomly around the world. Since RandomBug is a subclass of Tracker you 
        should make it leave tracks as it moves. Double click on the Actor class 
        so that you can view its code. Look for methods you can use to complete 
        this task.</p>
    </li>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/RandomBug_01.png"></div>
    <li>Before executing your code you will need to stop the world from drawing 
      smiley faces. An easy way to accomplish this is to comment out the code 
      that makes a call to <strong>createSmiley</strong> in the MyWorld's act 
      method.</li>
