<h1>Method properPlatformLanding</h1>
<p>When running the platform game in lesson 1 you might have noticed a problem when the frog attempted a "landing" on a platform. 
   If any part of the frog's body was touching the top of the platform the frog made a successful landing on the platform. 
   This problem is illustrated below where a frog makes a successful landing simple by touching the platform with the tip of its nose.</p>
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform2_01.png"></div>
   
<p>This problem is fixed by the method <strong>properPlatformLanding</strong> shown below.</p> 
  <div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform2_02.png"></div>
  
<p>This method uses the <strong>distance formula</strong> to calculate the distance between the center of the frog and the center of the
   platform. This distance is then used to calculate how much of the frog's body is on the platform. If at least 40% of the frog is
   on the platform the method returns true; otherwise it returns false. The method also returns false if the frog's center is
   not above the platform's center when the frog touches the platform.</p>
   
<h1>Method platFormTest</h1>
<p>To incorporate <strong>properPlatformLanding</strong> into the program we modify the <strong>platformTest</strong> method implemented in lesson 1.</p>
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform2_03.png"></div>
<p>Now if the frog does not land on the platform with at least 40% of its body touching the platform it will simply fall straight down.</p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Modify the <strong>MyWorld</strong> class constructor so that when the game starts the frog is on top of the middle platform.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform2_04.png"></div>
</li>
<li><p>Add a new method to the <strong>Frog</strong> class named <strong>endGameTest</strong>. This method should cause the 
   game to stop when the frog "falls" to the ground.</p>
   <p>Look in the documentation for the <strong>Greenfoot</strong> class to find a method you can use to stop the program (end the game).</p></li>
