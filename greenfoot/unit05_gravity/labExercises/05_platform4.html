<h1>Fish</h1>
<p>In this lesson the game has been modified to include fish. The fish can swim across the screen from left to right or
   right to left. Once a fish swims all of the way across the screen it is removed from the world. When a fish is 
   created by the world its location, direction, and speed are randomly determined. The fish themselves are also created at random.
   Each time the act method is called there is a 5% chance of a fish being added to the world.</p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<p>Add a method named <strong>fishTest</strong> to the Frog class so that when a fish collides with a frog the frog is moved or pushed 10 
   units away from the fish.</p>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Inorder to move the frog 10 units away from the fish the frog needs to know which direction the fish is swimming. One way to
accomplish this is to give the Frog class "access" to the Fish class's <strong>speed</strong> variable. If a fish's speed is negative
the fish is swimming to the left and if the speed is positive the fish is swimming to the right. </p>
<p>Add the following <strong>accessor method</strong> to the Fish class:</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform4_02.png"></div>
</li>
<li><p>Add a method to the Frog class named <strong>fishTest</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete the method <strong>fishTest</strong> using the following pseudocode:</p>
<div id="csOutput"><pre>
if fish touches frog then
   get the fish
   get the fish's speed
   if fish's speed &lt; 0 then
      move frog 10 units to the left
   else
      move frog 10 units to the right
   end if
end if
</pre></div>
<p>The following code can be used to get the colliding fish and retrieve its speed using the <strong>accessor method</strong> from step 1:</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:625px"><pre>
Actor actor = getOneIntersectingObject(Fish.class);    // get the fish
int fishSpeed = ((Fish)actor).<div id="csHighlight"><pre>getSpeed()</pre></div>;              // get the fish's speed
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>To include the fishTest method's behavior in the program add a call to the method in the Frog class's act method.</p>
