<h1>Linear Motion</h1>
<p>Add a <strong>Ball1</strong> object to the top of the world and press the <strong>Run</strong> button.</p>
<p>Ball1 is an example of <strong>linear motion</strong>. Linear motion is movement that occurs at a constant rate. Look at the
   code for the Ball1 class.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Gravity_01.png"></div>
<p>The class defines a variable named <strong>dy</strong> that represents the ball's vertical velocity. Linear movement is created
   by updating the ball's vertical position by dy each time the act method is executed. Since dy has a value of 2 the ball's vertical 
   position changes by 2 units each time it moves.</p>
   
<h1>Gravity</h1>
<p>Add a <strong>Ball2</strong> object to the top of the world and press the <strong>Run</strong> button.</p>

<p>Notice as Ball2 moves down its velocity increases. Ball2 exhibits <strong>quadratic motion</strong> instead of linear motion because its 
   velocity changes as opposed to being constant. This downward accelerating movement can be used to simulate <strong>gravity</strong>.
   Look at the code for the Ball2 class.</p>
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/Gravity_02.png"></div>
<P>The Ball2 class defines a variable named <strong>gravity</strong>. In the act method the ball's vertical velocity(dy) is increased
   by the value of gravity. The table below shows a ball's vertical velocity(dy) and vertical position(y) after the act method has been executed 10 
   times. Assume the ball starts with a vertical position(y) of 0 (The top of the world).</P>  
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/Gravity_03.png"></div>
   
 <h1>Initial Velocity</h1>
 <p>Add a <strong>Ball3</strong> object to the bottom of the world and press the <strong>Run</strong> button.</p>
 
 <p>The Ball3 class defines a variable named <strong>initialVelocity</strong>. This value is assigned to dy before the ball moves.
    By starting dy with a negative value the ball's movement is upward, but as the force of gravity is continually applied to dy the ball 
	eventually begins to move down as dy's value becomes positive. </p>
	<p><strong>Add</strong> the following code to Ball3's <strong>act</strong> method:</p>
	<div id="csCode"><pre>
if(getY() >= getWorld().getHeight() && dy > 0)  // if at bottom of world
{
    initialVelocity = initialVelocity * .8;   // decrease by 20%
    dy = (int)initialVelocity;    // cast initialVelocity to an int      
}</pre></div>
<p>This code causes Ball3 to continually bounce up and down until it eventually comes to rest. Each bounce is calculated to be 20% less than the previous bounce.
   Notice that the variable <strong>initialVelocity</strong> was declared a <strong>double</strong> so that the calculation for 
   reduction in bounce could be achieved.</p>
	
<h1>Horizontal Velocity</h1>
<p>Add a <strong>Ball4</strong> object to bottom left side of the world and press the <strong>Run</strong> button.</p>
<p>In Ball4 we add a variable named <strong>dx</strong> which represents a ball's horizontal velocity. </p>
<p>Change <strong>dx's</strong> value to 2 and compile and run the program again to see how the new value effects the ball's trajectory.</p>	
<p>Change <strong>dx's</strong> value to 20 and run the program again.</p>
	
<h1>Precise Movements</h1>
<p>Add a <strong>Ball5</strong> object to bottom left side of the world and press the <strong>Run</strong> button.</p>	
<p>In Ball5 all of the variables are declared <strong>double</strong> which allows us to create more precise movements.</p>
<p>Change some of the variables values and watch how the ball's movement is effected.</p>
<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>Look at the following line of code from Ball5's act method:</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>setLocation(<div id="csHighlight"><pre>(int)</pre></div>(getX() + dx), <div id="csHighlight"><pre>(int)</pre></div>(getY() + dy));</pre></div>
<p>An object's location within a world is always stored as a pair of integer values (x, y). Since our dx and dy values are doubles the 
   results of the calculations 
   inside the parentheses must be <strong>cast</strong> to integers before they can be passed to the setLocation method.</p>
