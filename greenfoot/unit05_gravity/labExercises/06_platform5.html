<h1>Release Shark</h1>
<P>This version of the program modifies the way the game ends. Instead of just ending the game when the frog lands on the ground 
   like previous versions, this version releases a shark to eat the frog when it lands on the ground.</P>
   
   <p>Look at the Frog method <strong>endGameTest</strong>.</p>
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform5_01.png"></div>

<p>When the frog touches the ground a Shark object is created and added to the world. The shark's initial position is off the screen
   to the right.</p>
<p>Notice the use of the boolean variable <strong>releaseShark</strong> in the if statement. This variable, called a flag, is 
   necessary to prevent more than one shark from being created each time the endGameTest method is called. Recall that the act method, and any code
   placed inside the act method, is executed over and over again as the program is running. Without this flag in the if statement the code
   that creates a Shark object would be called repeatedly as long as the frog is touching the ground resulting in numerous sharks being
   added to the world.</p>
   
   <p>The act method in the <strong>Shark</strong> class causes the shark to swim across the world from right to left.</p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Add a method named <strong>sharkTest</strong> to the Frog class. This method, when called, should test to 
   to see if the shark is touching the frog. If the shark is touching the frog the frog should be placed in the shark's mouth and carried
   off the screen.</p>
   
   <p>Use the following pseudocode:</p>
   <div id="csOutput" style="width:650px"><pre>
if frog is touching a shark then
   get reference to the shark
   move frog to shark's location
end if
</pre></div>
<p>The following code can be used to get a reference to the shark and move the frog to the shark's location: </p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>Actor shark = getOneIntersectingObject(Shark.class);     // get the shark
setLocation(shark.getX(), shark.getY());     // move frog to shark's location</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Make a call to the sharkTest method in the act method.</p></li>  
<li><p>Compile and run the program. Notice that the frog is positioned in the center of the shark.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust the frog's location so that the frog is positioned inside the shark's mouth.</p></li>
</ol>
