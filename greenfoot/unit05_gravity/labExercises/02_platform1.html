<p>In this 5 part series we are going to build a simple platform game that demonstrates jumping, gravity, and landing on a platform. The program
   we are going to develop uses a frog to demonstrate these techniques.</p>

<p>To help you better understand how it all works I am going to walk you through the code highlighting the most important parts.</p>

<h1>Platform Design</h1>
<p>Let's start our discussion with the platform design. Look at the game's world layout below.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform1_01.png"></div>
  <p>The platforms the frog will be landing on are actually made from two separate 
    actor classes named <strong>TopPlatform</strong> and <strong>BottomPlatform</strong>. 
    The reason the platform was designed this way is because a frog has a different 
    behavior depending upon which side of the platform it comes in contact with. 
    If the frog touches the top of the platform it should perform a landing and 
    if it touches the bottom of the platform it should just fall straight down. 
    By dividing the platform into two parts it was easy to determine which side 
    of the platform the frog collided with.</p>
<p>Another way to design a platform is to use only one platform object. When a platform is designed in this manner you have to calculate which part of 
   the platform the frog comes into contact with. This technique seemed more complicated so I opted for the first option.</p>
   
<h1>Instance Variables</h1>
<p>All of the interesting code is contained within the Frog class so let's take a look there first starting with the instance variables.</p>  
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform1_02.png"></div>
<p>The variable <strong>initialVelocity</strong> is used to give the frog jumping ability. When a frog jumps this value is assigned to the frog's
   <strong>vertical velocity(dy)</strong> which causes the frog to explode upward at a force of negative 9 units. As <strong>gravity</strong> is applied to the vertical velocity this
   value eventually becomes positive which causes the frog to fall back to the ground.</p>
   
<p>When a frog jumps it should not be able to jump again while it is in the air or change its direction. The purpose of the <strong>jumping</strong> variable is
   to monitor frog jumps. When a frog jumps this variable is set to <strong>true</strong>. When a frog lands from a jump this variable is set to <strong>false</strong>.
   A frog cannot jump while <strong>jumping</strong> is true.</p>
   
<p>The GreenfootImage variables <strong>faceRight1</strong> and <strong>faceLeft1</strong> store the frog image. The faceRight1 variable 
   stores the original frog image. A copy of this image is flipped horizontally and stored in the faceLeft1 variable. By doing it this
   way I did not have to create two frog image files. When a frog is facing 
   right the faceRight1 image is displayed and when the frog is facing left the faceLeft1 image is displayed. </p>
  
<h1>Constructor</h1>
<p>Recall that the Frog constructor is executed when the frog is first created. Any code placed in the constructor will be executed
   before the frog is displayed on the screen. Look at the Frog constructor.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform1_03.png"></div> 
<p>This code assigns the frog image to the two GreenfootImage variables <strong>faceRight1</strong> and <strong>faceLeft1</strong>.</p>

<h1>act Method</h1>
<p>Alot of things happen inside the Frog's <strong>act</strong> method. Instead of writing all of the code inside this method I chose to split it up
   into four methods named <strong>platformTest</strong>, <strong>movementTest</strong>, <strong>jumpTest</strong>, and <strong>updateLocation.</strong></p>
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform1_04.png"></div>
   <p>The order these methods are called in is important. Changing the order could cause the act method to not work properly.</p>
<h1>platFormTest Method </h1>
<p>The <strong>platformTest</strong> method tests to see if the frog collided with a platform. 
   If the frog collides with a TopPlatform the method causes the frog to "land" on the platform by setting its
   <strong>vertical(dy)</strong> and <strong>horizontal(dx)</strong> velocities to zero. Since the frog has "landed" the 
   <strong>jumping</strong> variable is set to false so the frog can perform a jump again.
   If the frog hits a BottomPlatform it sets the vertical velocity(dy) and gravity to 2 and .3 respectively 
   so the frog's action will be to fall straight down.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform1_05.png"></div>

<h1>movementTest Method</h1>
<p>This method provides the ability for a frog to move right or left if the right or left arrow keys are pressed. The <strong>jumping</strong> variable
   is also tested to see that it is false. If <strong>jumping</strong> is true pressing the arrow keys have no effect which prevents the frog from moving
   horizontally while it is performing a jump.</p>
<p>To move the frog the horizontal velocity(dx) is set to either -3 or 3.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform1_06.png"></div>

<h1>jumpTest Method</h1>
<p>This method tests to see if the up arrow key has been pressed. If it has been pressed the frog performs a "jump" by
   setting the frog's <strong>vertical velocity</strong> to <strong>initial velocity</strong> and setting <strong>gravity</strong> to .3. 
   The <strong>jumping</strong> variable is also tested to
   make sure a frog cannot perform a "jump" while it is currently "jumping".</p>
   
   <div id="csOutput">The implementation of the <strong>jumpTest</strong> method is left as an exercise.</div>
   
<h1>updateLocation Method</h1>
<p>This method updates the frog's location according to its current horizontal(dx) and vertical(dy)
   velocities. It also applies the force of gravity to the frog's vertical velocity(dy).</p>
 <div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform1_07.png"></div> 
 
 <p>The frog's vertical velocity(dy) is not constant. Because of the force of gravity its velocity decelerates as it goes up and accelerates
    as it goes down. This acceleration can cause a problem when the frog lands on the ground in that, depending upon its last
	vertical location before it reaches the ground, it might not stop falling for several units below the ground. To prevent this 
	from happening the following test is performed before the frog is moved:</p> 
  <div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform1_08.png"></div> 
  <p>The if statement checks to see if the current vertical velocity(dy) is added to the frog's current position(getY()) will this 
     cause the frog's
     new location to be below the established stopping point of 380. If the answer is yes then the vertical velocity is ignored and the
	 frog's vertical position is set to 380; otherwise the frog's location is updated normally by adding the vertical velocity(dy) to
	 its current vertical position(getY()). </p>
	 
<p>The second if statement checks to see if the frog is currently performing a "jump". If it is not jumping the horizontal velocity(dx) is 
   set to zero. Without this code segment the frog would continue to move horizontally without having pressed a left or right arrow key. If the
   frog is "jumping" the horizontal velocity is not set to zero which allows the frog to follow its current jump path until it lands.</p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<p>Implement the method <strong>jumpTest</strong>. </p>

<p>The method <strong>jumpTest</strong> tests to see if the up arrow key has been pressed. If it has been pressed the frog performs a "jump" by
   setting the frog's <strong>vertical velocity</strong> to <strong>initial velocity</strong>, setting <strong>gravity</strong> to .3 and setting
   <strong>jumping</strong> to true. 
   The <strong>jumping</strong> variable is also tested to make sure a frog cannot perform a "jump" while it is still currently "jumping".</p>
   
<p>Use the Greenfoot method <strong>getKey</strong> in your implementation.</p>

<p>Here is the pseudocode for the method:</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:650px"><pre>
use <strong>Greenfoot.getKey()</strong> to retrieve the last key that was pressed
if last key pressed was the up arrow key and jumping equals false then
   set <strong>vertical velocity</strong> to <strong>initial velocity</strong>
   set <strong>gravity</strong> to .3
   set <strong>jumping</strong> to true
end if
</pre></div>
