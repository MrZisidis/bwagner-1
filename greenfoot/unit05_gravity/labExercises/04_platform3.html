<h1>Moving Platforms</h1>
<p>Looking at the World for this lesson you will notice that there is now 6 platforms instead of 3.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform3_01.png"></div>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<p>In this lesson you are going to modify the game by having the platforms move down one unit every execution cycle. When the 
   platforms reach the bottom of the world they are moved to the top of the world so they can again move down through the world. This
   is the same behavior we used to move stars in unit 3.</p>
   
<p>The class structure in this scenario has been modified. A new class named <strong>Platform</strong> has been added and both the TopPlatform
   class and the BottomPlatform class are now declared as subclasses of this new class.</p>
   
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform3_03.png"></div>
   
<p>By making TopPlatform and BottomPlatform subclasses of the Platform class any code placed in the Platform class's act method will effect both
   TopPlatform objects and BottomPlatform objects. In other words, if I want to make both TopPlatforms and BottomPlatforms move all
    I have to do is place the code in the Platform class's act method and both TopPlatform objects and BottomPlatform objects will 
   automatically move.</p>
   
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Modify the Platform class's <strong>act</strong> method so that both top platforms and bottom platforms move down one
     unit every time the act method is called. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Moving the platforms one unit every time the act method is called causes the platforms to move to fast. One way to slow them down 
    is to create a <strong>counter</strong> variable that is incremented in the act method each time the act method is called, then include an if statement 
	that will only allow the platforms to move when the counter equals a multiple of 5. An example is shown below:</p>
	
	<div id="csCode" style="width:600px"><pre>if(counter % 5 == 0)  // counter is a multiple of 5
{
   setLocation(getX(), getY() + 1);
}
counter++;    // increment counter
</pre></div>
<p>Include this behavior in your code. Make sure to declare the counter variable as an instance variable in the Platform class.</p></li>
<li><p>When a platform reaches the bottom of the world move the platform to the top of the world so that it can continue to move through the 
	world from top to bottom. Here is the pseudocode for this process:</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:600px"><pre>
if getY() is greater than the height of the world then
   use setLocation to move platform to top of world
</pre></div></li>
<li><p>The <strong>endGameTest</strong> method that you implemented in the last lesson is included in this version of the program. 
   However while testing the code for the platform classes we do not want to end the game each time the frog touches the ground
   this could make testing the code difficult and inefficient. So to temporarily deactivate the endGameTest method the call to
   it in the act method was converted to a comment. Look at the act method below.</p></li>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Platform3_02.png"></div>
<p>Once you've tested the new code and you have verified that the platforms work properly, then activate the endGameTest method 
   by removing the comment symbols.</p>
</ol>
