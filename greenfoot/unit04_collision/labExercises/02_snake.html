<div id="csAssignmentTitle" align="center">Scary Snake</div>
<p>In this lesson we are going to write a program that has a snake and some mice. When the snake approaches a mouse the mouse gets scared
   and runs away from the snake in the opposite direction.</p>

<h1>Snake Class</h1>
<p>Let's start by compiling and running the program. Press the arrow keys to make the snake move. Did you notice a problem when the snake moved to its
   left? Yes, the snake's image is upside down. The problem occurs because of the way an image is rotated when you use the <strong>setRotation</strong> method. There is a method in the Snake class named <strong>flipImage</strong> that fixes 
   this problem. To apply the fix do the following:</p>
   <ol id="csList">
   <li><p>Open the <strong>Snake</strong> class to view its code.</p></li> 
   <li><p>In the act method remove the comment symbols (//) from in front of the <strong>flipImage</strong> method call.</p></li>
   <li><p>Compile and run the program again. Test the left arrow key. The image should now be upright.</p></li>  
   </ol>
   <p>The flipImage method uses a method in the GreenfootImage class called <strong>mirrorVertically</strong>. This method when applied to an image will flip its
      orientation vertically. Look at the following code from the flipImage method:</p>
	  <div id="csCode"><pre>getImage().mirrorVertically();</pre></div>
	  <p>The method <strong>getImage</strong> gets the snakes image and then the method <strong>mirrorVertically</strong> flips the image.</p>
<h3>Method collisionCheck</h3>
<p>The method <strong>collisionCheck</strong> checks to see if a snake has collided with a mouse.</p>
<p>To make the mouse run away when the snake comes near the method needs to know which mouse the snake is touching. To identify the mouse we
   need to use the Actor method <strong>getOneIntersectingObject</strong>. If you recall from the previous lesson the getOneIntersectingObject method 
   returns the Actor that caused the collision. Look at the following code:</p>
   <div id="csCode"><pre>Actor actor = getOneIntersectingObject(Mouse.class);
if(actor != null)
{
   actor.runAway(getRotation());  // tell mouse to run away
}
</pre></div>
<p>The code above is suppose to cause a mouse to run away from the snake if the snake touches it. This code, however, causes the following compiler
   error - <strong>cannot find symbol - method runAway(int)</strong>. If you look at the Mouse class the method runAway does exist, so why does the compiler 
   say it does not? To answer this question we need to look more closely at the following line of code:</p>
      <div id="csCode"><pre>Actor actor = getOneIntersectingObject(Mouse.class);</pre></div>
<p>According the Actor class documentation the getOneIntersectingObject method returns an Actor. So to accomodate this method we created
   an Actor variable named actor to store this return value. But is this Actor just an Actor? No, it is actually a Mouse. 
   How do we know it is a Mouse? Because we told the getOneIntersectingObject method we only wanted mice.</p>
   <div id="csCode"><pre>Actor actor = getOneIntersectingObject(<div id="csHighlight"><pre>Mouse.class</pre></div>);</pre></div>
<p>To summarize, the getOneIntersectingObject method can only return Actors even though the Actor it is returning is actually a Mouse. Here is 
   the key to the problem. Since the returned object is an Actor it can only use Actor methods. The <strong>runAway</strong> method is a Mouse method therefore the variable
   actor cannot call or use this method. Look at the following code:</p>
   <div id="csCode"><pre>actor.runAway(getRotation());    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>// error</pre></div> </pre></div>
   <P>The actor variable is attempting to call the method runAway, but it can't because runAway is a Mouse method and the actor variable
      can only call Actor methods.</P>
<p>Fortunately there is a way to fix this problem and it is called <strong>casting</strong>. Look at the following code:</p>
   <div id="csCode"><pre>Actor actor = getOneIntersectingObject(Mouse.class);
if(actor != null)
{
    Mouse mouse = <div id="csHighlight"><pre>(Mouse)</pre></div>actor;  // cast actor to a Mouse
    mouse.runAway(getRotation());  // tell mouse to run away
}
</pre></div>
<p>Using casting we convert the object in actor to a Mouse and store its reference in a Mouse variable named <strong>mouse</strong>. 
   This only works because the object stored in actor is really a Mouse. With the conversion done the <strong>runAway</strong> method is now called by a Mouse variable which makes the compiler very happy. Remember since the
   Mouse class is a subclass of Actor a mouse object can use both Actor and Mouse methods.</p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Add the code discussed above into the <strong>collisionCheck</strong> method.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Add some mice to the world and run the program. When the snake touches a mouse the mouse should move away in the 
       opposite direction.</p></li>
