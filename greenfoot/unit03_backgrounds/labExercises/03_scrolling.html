<h1>ScrollWorld Class</h1>
<p>We can create animations in our greenfoot programs by simply moving actors within a world. Another technique that can be used to create animation is to move a world's background, creating what
   is called a <strong>scrolling background</strong>. The ScrollWorld class demonstrates this technique by moving or scrolling a road background from right to left across the screen leaving a Car actor stationary in the middle of the world.</p>
<p>Double-click on the <strong>ScrollWorld</strong> class to view its code.</p>
<p>The ScrollWorld class contains one integer variable named <strong>SCROLL_SPEED</strong>. The purpose of this variable is to track how fast the road background moves. 
       Since the program is designed to scroll the road from right to left the SCROLL_SPEED variable is initially assigned a value of -3. The user can increase or decrease the scroll speed by pressing
	   the right or left arrow keys.</p>
	   
<p>The ScrollWorld's <strong>act</strong> method starts by making a call to the method <strong>scrollBackground</strong>. It is this method that produces the scrolling background effect. The act method also has code 
       to increase or decrease the SCROLL_SPEED when the user presses the right or left arrow keys.</p>

<h1>Method scrollBackground</h1>
<p>In this section we will walk through the 3 steps required to produce a scrolling background. To make a scrolling background you must select a 
   background image that is designed in such a way that one end of the image can connect to the other end of the image forming a seamless connection 
   similar to the way a tile is formed. In this program we are going to use an image for the background that will mimic a road that goes by as a car
   drives on it. The illustration below
   shows this road background. The image is outlined in blue to signify that this is the original background image.</p></li>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Road_01.png"></div>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>The first step in creating a scrolling background is to create a new image that is a duplicate or copy of the original background. 
       This is accomplished with the following code:</p>

<div id="csCode" style="width:625px"><pre>GreenfootImage copy = new GreenfootImage(getBackground());</pre></div>
<p>The illustration below shows the image that the variable <strong>copy</strong> references. This image is outlined in red to signify that it is not the world's background image. It is simply an image that 
   is a duplicate of the background image.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Road_011.png"></div>
</li>
<li><p>The second step is to place this new image (highlighted in red) on top of the original background image but moved over 3 units to the left.
       These 3 units are represented by the SCROLL_SPEED variable. This step will give the illusion that the road has moved to the left. In this step 
	   the background image is modified.
	   

<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Road_02.png"> <img src="greenfoot/images/Road_03.png"></div>
This step is accomplished with the following code:</p> 
	   <div id="csCode" style="width:625px"><pre>getBackground().drawImage(copy, SCROLL_SPEED, 0);</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>The third and final step is to attach the copy image to the right end of the background image that
        was modified in step 2. By doing this step we can continually rebuild the background image so it gives the illusion of going on forever.
		The illustration below demonstrates this step. The dotted lines mark the part of the background image that will be visible on 
		the screen.</p>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Road_04.png"></div>

This step is accomplished with the following code:</p> 
	   <div id="csCode" style="width:625px"><pre>getBackground().drawImage(copy, getBackground().getWidth() + SCROLL_SPEED, 0);</pre></div>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Complete the <strong>scrollBackground</strong> method by adding the code discussed above. When completed the method should look like the following.</p></li>
<div><img src="greenfoot/images/Road_05.png"></div>
</li>
<li><p>Modify the <strong>Car</strong> class's act method so that the car can move up and down.</p>
    <p>Use the <strong>Greenfoot</strong> class's <strong>isKeyDown</strong> method.</p></li>
<li><p>Add if statements so the car's movement can be restricted to the top and bottom boundaries of the road. 
	   Use a y-value of 135 as the top boundary and y-value of 250 as the bottom boundary.</p></li>
